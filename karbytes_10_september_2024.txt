// The following values and their respective definitions are considered to be karbytes' (current) secondary values when juxtaposed with karbytes' primary values which are defined in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_primary_values/

1. SELF_ESTEEM: evaluation of oneself as being worthy of one's own admiration and material investment (especially as a consequence of oneself successfully overcoming challenges and attaining one's goals).

2. COMFORT: experience which is devoid of significant suffering; experience which is characterized as being more pleasurable than painful (and only painful to a trivial extent at most).

3. KINDNESS: demonstrated investment in the welfare of a particular sentient entity (especially by deliberately refraining from deliberately causing that being to experience a significant loss of comfort).

// Note that, like the referenced web page named karbytes_primary_values, the three values which are defined on this page (which is named karbytes_10_september_2024) are listed in descending order in terms of priority (which means that SELF_ESTEEM is considered by karbytes to be a higher-priority value than is COMFORT while COMFORT is considered by karbytes to be a higher-priority value  than is KINDNESS).

// Overall (and when considering both the aforementioned web page named karbytes_primary_values and this web page), karbytes considers TRUTH to be a higher-priority personal value than is FREEDOM (while karbytes considers FREEDOM to be a higher-priority personal value than is INNOVATION (while karbytes considers INNOVATION to be a higher-priority personal value than is SELF_ESTEEM (while karbytes considers SELF_ESTEEM to be a higher-priority personal value than is COMFORT (while karbytes considers COMFORT to be a higher-priority personal value than KINDNESS)))).
