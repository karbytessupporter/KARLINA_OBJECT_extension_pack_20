I finally got some (over-ear) headphones today from one of the fanciest Target stores I have ever been to (and it was the first time I stepped foot inside that upstairs Target store in downtown Sunnyvale approximately three hours ago (and right now is approximately 12:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_SEPTEMBER_2024). 

I'm sitting at the courtyard between Philz Coffee and the Caltrain station. There is one large gray tent set up in the courtyard perhaps in Wi-Fi range of the Philz Coffee cafe. According to news sources I checked, there may be some rainfall in this area throughout the week (and there has been a significant drop in air temperature and increase in cloud cover and wind since yesterday). 

Homeless people have allegedly been increasing in numbers due to economic hardships (spurred on by rising costs of living in part due to supply shortages and logistics impairments due to the ongoing foreign wars such as the war initiated by Russia against Ukraine during the past three years and mass layoff
layoffs at many companies partly due to the advant of automation and what I think are deliberately unsustainable new minimum wage standards for fast food employees in California (which is $20 unlike many other arguably more difficult and necessary hourly jobs (and I think that new ridiculously high minimum wage for fast food employees is designed to incentive restaurant owners reducing human staff to just what is necessary in order to not go into debt paying employees while automation could dramatically cut labor costs and the stress of having many people in a small kitchen))). I have been reading many news stories during the past three years about how major cities in the San Francisco Bay Area such as San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and even Berkeley have been conducting "very aggressive" homeless encampment sweeps and arresting homeless people who fail to leave the premises before the sweeping date (along with homeless people getting their possessions vandalized and stolen). I think the current strategy these cities (and larger encompassing country) are doing to "address" homelessness is basically little more than keeping those people from settling down so that they are rendered docile out of exhaustion and discomfort or perhaps run ragged to the point of intentional ruin (i.e. an early death). These are just partially informed thoughts I have. I honestly see there are multiple positions which seem somewhat valid to take on the matter. For instance, one part of me thinks it is unfair for people who work hard long hours regularly (to support people other than just themselves through direct marketable services and through paying income taxes which help pay for services "free loaders" take advantage of while themselves not working (much or at all) like their tax-paying counterparts do) to have to be the "designated worker bees" of the colony while the "lazy drone bees" hardly seem to contribute to the hive's upkeep. Another part of me (which seems to be what I overwhelmingly side with) thinks that most human jobs are frivolous wastes of time which could be accomplished more efficiently, safely, and reliably if outsourced to machines and thar those "frivolous" jobs are being held merely to keep the respective employees from becoming too lazy, entitled, and ungovernable to manage. I think that eventually more than 70% of the adult population will be mostly unemployed (while subsisting on an unconditional basic income which generously covers basic costs of living and even allows recipients to pursue a post-high-school education for the sake of fostering individual and collective well-being) while less than 30% of humans would be employed for specialized roles which are essentially not outsource-able to robots. I have done research over the past five plus years suggesting that there are more than enough material resources (including housing) to provide every person a decent standard of living already but people are persuaded by mainstream media and governance to assume that false scarcity of such resources is primarily due to a supply and knowledge/skills shortage. Soon I think I will be proven right (as in five years or fewer). Solar energy seems to remain grossly underutilized as a pollution-free and portable means for generating use-able electricity/energy. Lab grown meat could end the business of animal slaughter and rainforest clearing. The solutions seem to exist (at least prototypically) to the seemingly insurmountable global problems I see news outlets and personalities mostly just flippantly glossing over and pushing to the side for someone else to deal with later (which may never come before some apocalypse of apathy and myopia kills all the humans (though I am not (yet) that pessimistic (because I see how incredibly rapid recent human technological advancements have been and hence expect those "exponential" trends (especially in computing) to continue).

Last thing (and what originally compelled me to write this note): holy shit, over-ear headphones paired with ear plugs and decent music or sound-blocking noise generators are literally making the difference between me not being able to concentrate and feel comfortable in populous and busy settings and me being able to literally feel like I'm at home in my own room happily immersed in my own insular bubble of introverted bliss. It was foolish of me to go for so long without such equipment. I could say the same thing about having my own bicycle. Such material assets have dramatically expanded my range of possibilities for how I can live relatively cheaply, sustainably (ecologically wise), and joyfully. I hope my blog helps prove to myself and others that it is entirely feasible to live in a way which is affordable, fun, productive, reasonably safe, and minimally harmful to the environment (and the delicate ecosystems (whether naturally occurring or human engineered) which help to sustain and enrich human life across all the planets, spaceships, et cetera).
