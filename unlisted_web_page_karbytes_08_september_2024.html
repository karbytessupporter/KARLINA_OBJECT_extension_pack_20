Each member of that club must be voluntarily single (rather than in a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committed_relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;committed relationship&#8221;</a> with any person other than itself) for the remainder of its lifespan.</p>
<p>2. Each member of that club must have zero children (whether biological offspring or adopted) and be voluntarily childless for the remainder of its lifespan.</p>
<p>3. Each member of that club must be a geek with well-established &#8220;geek qualifications&#8221; in the form of relevant hobbies and/or relevant career (as determined by karbytes).</p>
<p>// This note (which is named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_08_september_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_08_september_2024</a>) is a follow-up to the previous note (which is named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_07_september_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_07_september_2024</a>).</p>
<p>// Note that members of the aforementioned club are not required to ever <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interact</a> with each other &#8220;in person&#8221; nor even &#8220;online&#8221; (nor telepathically remotely).
