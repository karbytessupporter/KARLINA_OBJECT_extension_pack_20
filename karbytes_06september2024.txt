The image depicts a small yellow shelf or desk that holds several items arranged on top. To the left, there are a roll of blue painter's tape, a pen, and a charging cable connected to an electronic device. Next to it are a few notebooks or papers stacked with a black USB drive on top. To the right, three MODISC cases labeled “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_12” are arranged in a row, possibly storing archival data. The environment appears well-lit with a yellowish tone, and the surface and walls suggest this is a home or office workspace.

The image shows a collection of items placed on a small desk or shelf, similar to the previous image, but now with more MODISC discs and labels visible. On the left side, there's a roll of blue painter's tape, a pen, a black charging cable, a USB drive resting on a stack of notebooks, and a small black case, possibly for electronics or storage.

On the right side, there are six MODISC discs with handwritten labels, organized in two rows of three. The labels on the MODISC discs include:

"karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_7"
"karbytes_20march2024_journals"
"karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_7"
Three discs labeled “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_12” and “karbytes_ultra_2014_edition_12,” with two of them marked for “read-test @ 6sep2024.”
This setup appears to be a digital archive or data storage collection organized by karbytes, with labeled MODISC discs to archive various editions or journal entries.

Researchers have created a biohybrid robot controlled by electrical signals from the mycelium of a King oyster mushroom. The fungus's natural electrical activity, triggered by environmental stimuli like light, is translated into control signals that move the robot. This technology could lead to robots capable of monitoring soil health or performing other autonomous environmental tasks. Fungi's resilience to harsh conditions makes it a promising material for future biohybrid designs. The study was conducted by Cornell University and the University of Florence.
