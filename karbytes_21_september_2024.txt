Here comes another (relatively) “low quality” journal entry (which is related to a recent journal entry I created named karbytes_19_september_2024)…

Today while browsing my (Google-curated) news feed, I came across some interesting articles pertaining to cultural phenomena I find somewhat intriguing. The first of such articles I am referring to is about how many participants who recently participated in an obstacle course team-oriented race named Tough Mudder became violently ill after coming into contact with bacteria-contaminated water which was used to create the mud part of the obstacle course. I read further into what Tough Mudder is and saw an anecdote saying that it “allows urban professionals to be savage again”. (That comment in particular is what intrigued me because I have long suspected that I have not been motivated nor eligible (according to other people) to work in an office setting (i.e. urban professional setting) due to the fact that I am a bit “savage” looking, feeling, and acting (and I like being that way and really do not want to have to become much more “clean cut” and “politically correct” than I currently am just to earn acceptance into the “white collar” professional world. In particular, I like being able to camp outside before work or whatever I end up doing the next day because it makes me feel like a modern cowboy riding on my “steel horse” of a bicycle and feeling deeply connected to nature and immersed in its incomparable beauty, majesty, and intrigue which no human-made environment can hold a candle to)).

I scrolled down further (after deciding to research why blimps are so rare (with there being only 25 left as of 2021) because, around 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time this morning (which is actually 19_SEPTEMBER_2024), I was fortunate enough to be able to witness and capture a photograph of a giant white blimp which slowly floated from Mountain View to Sunnyvale sloughs (where I was sitting) to Fremont and eventually coming back around to do at least one more of such loops (and I assume that blimp was from the nearby Lockheed Martin or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (i.e. NASA) facilities)) and found a rather frivolous article referring to a comic about what I describe as “unfunny clowns” living in a world where literally everyone is what I consider to be “lame” and hollow (i.e. devoid of intelligence, depth, authenticity, and complexity) named @promptlypaneled. Below are some hyperlinks from choice screenshots from that comic (which seems to garner a lot of traffic due to the fact that it appeals to what I think is a rather large percentage of the population characterized by it not quite knowing how or being willing to “break the glass ceiling” while, instead, succumbing to being a “fake nerd” entrenched in the straitjacket of being some heterosexual female (with a heterosexual boyfriend, of course) acting literally as bad as I ((may have) exaggerated) that (many if not most if not all) women are in the aforementioned journal entry I wrote named karbytes_19_september_2024).

That comic reminds me of another “girl comic” named @cassandracalin which, despite not coming across as explicitly “nerdy” (i.e. lacking in references to culturally “nerdy” pastimes such as table top games but seemingly little else (which I think is a lazy consumerist cop-out compared to actually being a geek who studies and has hobbies pertaining to (natural) sciences, mathematics, technology, and engineering), seems to essentially amount to the same subject matter. Screenshot references from that comic are also featured lower on this web page.

The main point of this journal entry is to, hopefully, put an end to having to mention “minorities” whether it be “female-identifying”, “transgendered”, “non-white racial ethnicity”, (non-serious if not made-up (or even something as serious as what Steven Hawking endured: (almost) full-body paralysis despite being a world-renowned pioneer in black hole cosmology) “disability status”), and socioeconomic “class” (because I think that any human of any of those aforementioned categories could and made a name for themselves and achieved what I consider to be praise-worthy merits all while trying not to call attention to their so-called “minority” status). I do want to show support for “minority” people being successful in so-called “white, male, able-bodied” domains without having to (rudely) call attention to the fact that those people are not necessarily “white, male, able-bodied”. Instead, I would rather promote the idea of genuine meritocracy where individuality rather than group-identification and personal achievements rather than nepotism, tribalism, or living vicariously through other people is what is emphasized and rewarded. Otherwise, what we have to notice about people is rather shallow, unoriginal, and not exactly what I call something to be proud of nor to regard as an actual achievement.

Bottom Line: in my vision of what a utopia is, everyone is, to the fullest extent possible, treated as having equal rights and equal merit to everyone else (which means that no one gets “special treatment” merely for having some kind of historically “non alpha” status while, instead, everyone is treated as having neither “alpha” nor “beta” status but, instead, something in between “alpha” (dominant over other people) and “beta” (subordinate to other people)). I think people in such a society would be more likeable because they would be less wimpy (i.e. the worst of beta) and less entitled (i.e. the worst of alpha).

One Last Remark: I remember being told that a direct democracy has (historically) only been possible to implement for relatively small population sizes and that is why the United States of America (and seemingly most other “first world nations”) employ elected officials instead of implementing a direct democracy. I think that it is entirely feasible now for large-scale nations to implement a direct democracy using Internet-based voting on policies instead of on politicians. What is required that seems to still be lacking is a more educated populous truly capable of thinking on a “systems level” and not just limiting their individual scopes of concern to what those individuals are personally interested in or personally involved in. Artificial intelligence, in my opinion, is proving to be a more fair and reliable mediator than humans are when it comes to “checks and balances”. In such a utopia (which is mediated by artificial intelligence and where there is no central authority), governance is distributed relatively evenly across the entire population (where each person has the same legal level of political representation as every other person in that population).

The actual last remark: Perhaps the comics and comments I raised about them pertain exclusively to “white girls” and “white culture”. I hope to be less explicitly “white centric” in my representation of human culture in future additions to my blog. I understand that karbytes seems to have what appears to be a “white” centric origin because it does not include ethnically diverse nor artistically diverse nor very many high-quality examples of culture in it (at least not yet). That may be in part due to the fact that I spent most of my twenties ensconced in a rather insular intimate relationship which centered around what appeals to a “white male” nerd/geek. I am single now (and intend to remain that way forever more), but I still retain what I think are core aspects of being identified with that culture (but I also am a lot less “white” now than I was while “in relationship” to SED). What I mean by that is that I am not explicitly centered around one particular race and I am a lot more open-minded and interested in cultural diversity than I used to be. In particular, I no longer think of “white” as being the default race. (I still, nevertheless, think of being “male” as the default gender (and I go into more detail as to why I feel that way in the aforementioned journal entry named karbytes_19_september_2024)).

In all honesty, I am not making a special effort (unless I am being coerced by people (or things) other than myself “against my will”) to assimilate to or represent cultures other than “Euro-centricism” on my blogging platform (or personal expression or lifestyle in general). For that reason, I think many people would be quick (and even eager) to accuse me of being racist against ethnicities other than those I appear to show the most affinity towards and representation of (and hence suggest that I am being a “white supremacist”).

In all honesty, the experiences I have been having across the past five years have lead me to conclude that there are people who are desperate to portray me as “white supremacist” and even “genocidal” seemingly in order to undermine my credibility as a public intellectual and to thwart any “momentum” I have been trying to build and sustain towards achieving my personal goals in a consistent and efficient (and minimally painful) manner.

Because there seem to be many people “against me” attaining the success I am after, I decided that it is a waste of my energy to try to convince people that I am not the villain my enemies make me out to be. I think that those who seriously take interest in karbytes and appreciate what karbytes is about are willing to actually read my content and even talk to me directly instead of merely taking what other people have to say about me or my work as all that is needed to form an accurate depiction of what I am and about.

My blog is not for the intellectually lazy nor the dishonest nor the cowardly (though it is my intention for all of the files which comprise karbytes to be publicly accessible forever after being published (which means that no person is excluded from who I authorize to access that content)). Instead, it is for people who share my values and seriously intend to implement them in their own lives.
