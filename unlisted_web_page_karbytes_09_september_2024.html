<p>// This note was published in order to redress what was said in the previous note (which is named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_08_september_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">08_september_2024</a>).</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Why are you &#8216;correcting&#8217; what you already said in your <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;I think I sound like a snob and someone who is too attached to having a geek identity. (I do not redact the parts of the previous note in which I implicitly suggested that I want to remain single and childless for the rest of my life. I just did not want to alienate people who do not share my lifestyle preferences nor limit who I can socialize with to only people who fit the requirements of that club (which is really just a hypothetical construct and not an actual organization)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;If you are not attached to having a geek identity, then what are you promoting yourself as being?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;I think I will always consider myself to be a geek (especially since I established what I think is sufficient &#8216;geek cred&#8217; by compiling karbytes and archiving all content within it which was published before 07_SEPTEMBER_2024 onto M_DISCs). I consider the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest M_DISC backup of karbytes</a> to be the greatest milestone I ever achieved thus far in my lifespan. Now I feel ready to not be as hard-driving and desperate to prove myself because I got that major milestone accomplishment completed (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_06_september_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the creation and archiving of all that karbytes content</a>).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;You did not quite answer my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;What is the question?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;What are you without your geek identity?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Without my geek identity, I am just an animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;You are not just any animal. You are a unique allocation of space, time, matter, and energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;I might appear to be a unique instantiation of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a>-originated resources to you and me, but it could be the case that there are multiple identical copies of me (and the encompassing universe I inhabit) elsewhere throughout the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a> of all multiverses (if such a thing exists).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Are you afraid of losing your <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memories</a> and/or hard-won karbytes <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> (which you so meticulously created, curated, and archived)?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Of course I am afraid of losing those things. I cherish those things (especially <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>) very much. I consider karbytes to be my proudest achievement and most cherished possession (and I also consider it to be a part of my &#8216;soul&#8217; and something which I am very sentimentally attached to). What I must contend with, however, is the fact that almost no other person other than myself feels any emotional attachment towards karbytes. That is why I am trying not to mention karbytes much to persons other than myself. Based on how many humans have recently treated me, I have come to the conclusion that many humans would laugh in sadistic delight over me losing karbytes (and I imagine that such people would smugly preach to me that I was too attached to mere physical possessions and not sufficiently attached to humans other than myself).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_2: &#8220;If it is any consolation, karbytes will always exist beyond any <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame of reference</a> given the fact that (a) it came into material existence (and your subjective experience confirms that) and (b) a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noumenal</a> copy of it exists unconditionally (which is a tautology given that all noumena unconditionally exist (and there exists a noumenal copy of each discrete <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomenon</a>).&#8221;
