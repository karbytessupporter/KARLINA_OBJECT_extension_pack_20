I want to be very clear about something I believe (and find quite useful to believe): every person without exception believes that nothing but itself is worth preserving (and that explains why climate change remains an unresolved issue).

In other words, what I profess to believe is that “no one loves any person (or thing) except for itself.”

I think that those who believe in some afterlife are too fantasy driven for me to find sufficient value in taking seriously. Hence, I do not take them seriously given how little they seem to appreciate their current lives and the world they currently inhabit (and do not seem to mind letting turn into an uninhabitable wasteland after they die (which means they do not mind if persons inhabitating that world after they die suffer from torturous habitat degradation along with the loss of what humans built over many generations and across thousands of years)).

I will take seriously only those who admit to being agnostic about any after life (whether that afterlife is heaven, hell, or reincarnation).

Then I imagine that the only people I would consider even remotely to be friends of mine are those who admit to only caring about themselves and to being uncertain about what science has yet to “conclusively” (with substantial peer-reviewed and time-tested empirical and logical evidence) prove.

If such friends and I were in a burning building, we would already know at that point that “it’s every person for itself” and that none of us would try to save someone other than itself at its own expense (or even at all). That, I believe, would spare me the disappointment of being betrayed when I learn “too late” that my friend was merely lying to me when it said that it would sacrifice itself to save me or, at the very least, attempt to rescue me if doing was feasible and did not necessarily involve that person having to sacrifice its own life.

I do not think a human helps anyone but itself without expectation of reward (i.e. induction on pleasurable experience or prevention/reduction of painful experience) for doing so. Otherwise, it would not bother expending resources trying to help anyone but itself.

If I care about anything at all, I only care about it because I find utility in it; because it provides me pleasurable experiences or reduces my misery.

I do not believe that anyone says anything other than, “I love myself,” when that person professes its love for something other than itself.

(I love nature only if I exist).

Well, those are my thoughts for tonight. Good night!
